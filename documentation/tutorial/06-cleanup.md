# Cleanup
This final step of the tutorial focuses on removing Juju applications, models and controller to completely cleanup the deployment.

## Remove the Controller
If youâ€™re done with testing and would like to free up resources on your machine, run the following command:

```
juju destroy-controller -y --destroy-all-models --destroy-storage superset-controller
```

[note]
When you remove the models, all the data in PostgreSQL and any other applications inside the model are lost.
