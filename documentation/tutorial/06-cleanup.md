# Cleanup

This is part of the
[Charmed Superset Tutorial]().
Please refer to this page for more information and the overview of the content.

In this tutorial, we have successfully deployed Charmed Superset UI and created our first dashboard!

## Removing Charmed Superset
If youâ€™re done with testing and would like to free up resources on your machine, just run the following command:

```
juju destroy-controller -y --destroy-all-models --destroy-storage superset-controller
```

Warning: when you remove the models as shown, you will lose all the data in PostgreSQL and any other applications inside the model!
