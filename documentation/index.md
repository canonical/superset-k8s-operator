Charmed Superset is an open-source, production-ready data exploration and visualization platform based on [Apache Superset<sup>TM</sup>](https://superset.apache.org/).

Superset can replace or augment proprietary business intelligence tools. It integrates with a variety of data sources and provides a powerful SQL editor for advanced querying as well as a low-code interface for building charts and dashboards.

Charmed Superset provides data insights in a repeatable, governable and flexible manner, contributing to higher data literacy and data-driven business decisions.

It is intended for data practitioners who require advanced visualization without the complexity of deployment and on-going service management.
